<h1>Marginal effects in a linear model</h1>
<p>Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. However, we do need to be careful when we use it when fixed effects are included. In a linear model, everything works out fine. However, in a non-linear model, you may not want to use margins, since it’s not calculating what you have in mind.</p>
<p>In a linear model with fixed effects, we can do it either by “demeaning” every variable, or include dummy variables. They return the same results. Fortunately, marginal effects can be calculated the same way in both models.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>clear
sysuse auto
xtset rep78
xtreg price c.mpg##c.trunk, fe
margins , dydx(mpg)
reg price c.mpg##c.trunk i.rep78
margins , dydx(mpg)
</code></pre>
<p>All is fine.</p>

<div id="marginal-effects-in-a-non-linear-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Marginal effects in a non-linear model</h1>
<p>In a nonlinear model, we need to be more careful:</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>clear
sysuse auto
xtset rep78
xtpoisson price mpg trunk, fe
margins , dydx(mpg)
margins , dydx(mpg) predict(nu0)
poisson price mpg trunk i.rep78
margins , dydx(mpg)
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, “xtpoisson, fe” and “poisson i.rep78” returns the same results. Fixed effect Poisson model (sometimes called conditional fixed effect Poisson) is the same models as a Poisson model with dummies, just like a linear model (OLS with dummies is the same as fixed effect OLS). Poisson model and OLS are unique in this sense that there is no “incidental paramater” problem.</p>
<p>We see in this example, margins commands do not return the same marginal effects, even though the models are the same. The reason behind this is that in a conditional fixed effect Poisson, the fixed effects are not estimated (they are not in the final likelihood function that gets estimated). Therefore, we’ll have to make a decision what values to use as the values of the fixed effects. “margins, predict(nu0)” simply set all fixed effects to zero. On the other hand, margins after Poisson model with dummies does not do that. The fixed effect in that case gets estimated. Therefore the marginal effects in that case make more sense.</p>
<p>So our advise for a conditioanl Poisson model is that we should not use margins to calculate marginal effects afterwards; instead, we should simply stick with the original coefficient estimates.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to the conditional logit model. Fixed effects are not estimated in that model; simply setting them to zero does not make too much sense. In addition, conditional logit model is not the same model as a logit model with dummies, since there is the “incidental paramater” problem. Again, we should just focus on the coefficient estimates as the effect on the logged odds.</p>
