Let's walk through some steps for web scraping with R. At the bottom of [this page](https://www.google.com/patents/US608845) there is a table of references that I want to scrape. Let's use the [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) package to get the HTML associated with that page:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(rvest)

html <- read_html("https://www.google.com/patents/US608845")
html
```

Now let's use the `html_nodes()` function to extract the table of interest. I used Chrome's Developer Tools to get the XPath of the table.

```{r}
referenced_by <- html_node(html, xpath='//*[@id="intl_patents_v"]/div[8]/table')
referenced_by
```

Now let's convert that HTML table into a data frame.

```{r, message = FALSE}
html_table(referenced_by)
```

We've only scratched the surface here, but I hope this example shows off the convenience of the rvest package.
