# RCS Documentation

The posts in this repository have been posted online at [http://hbs-rcs.github.io/](http://hbs-rcs.github.io/). The site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site. The content as two major strands:

1.  Documentation for the HBS Research Grid
2.  Documentation of various statistics issues that researchers at HBS frequently encounter

Here are a few reasons why I like publishing technical content in this manner:

1.  Syntax highlighting using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
2.  Mathematics rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
3.  Extremely customizable
4.  Easy to deply
5.  Version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
